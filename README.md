# SuperStore_Dashboard
This Dashboard indicates the sales and profit data of a superstore (Data from Kaggle). The visual representations allow the end user to monitor key performance, track progress, and identify trends and patterns that can help improve business operations.
Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in various Power BI aspects, including:
* Formatting, cleaning, transforming and standardisation of the data using Power query editor.
* Application of merge queries and append queries to make dataset meaningful and connecting multiple datasets.
* DAX language for custom calculations.
* Efficient use of slicers and filters, and different inbuilt functions to get meaningful insights.
* Understanding and application of different types of visuals.
* Reporting and design principles to create impactful reports.
